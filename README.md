### Find copyrighted content on YouTube

This program was developed to find all music videos by Suzanita & Kaskata on YouTube which contain a copyrighted version of the song "Allahumma Ya Subuhun". Using pre-defined search terms, the video links are collected and sent to YouTube's copyright violations team for removal of the content.

The program which searches for the videos is called: search_youtube_videos_wAPI.ipynb
There is another program which I wrote to check if YouTube has removed the videos. That one is: get_number_views_youtube_clips.ipynb
